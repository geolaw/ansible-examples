The buffalo nas does not have NFS built in - and its CIFS sharing is very elementary -
cifs version 1 only.

the buffalo nas operating system reverts back to its defaults after a reboot, as such, every time
there is a power blip, any changes that had been made  -
new directories created such as /opt/bin, etc ... all get wiped out.

files in existing default directories, such as /root/.ssh/authorized_keys remain.



ansible-playbook -i hosts buffalo.yml

runs as root, so no sudo or username needed
